<h2>Actions to Mitigate the Effecs</h2>
<h2> Cyberbullying and Harassment </h2>
	<p> <img src = "cyberbullying.jpg" align = "left" width = "350" height = "300" > <font size = +2> Don’t respond or retaliate. Sometimes a reaction is exactly what aggressors are looking for because they think it gives them power over you, and you don’t want to empower a bully.
		Reach out for help – especially if the behavior’s really getting to you. You deserve backup. See if there’s someone who can listen, help you process what’s going on and work through it – a friend, relative or maybe an adult you trust.

<h2> Personal Data Hacking </h2>
	<p> <img src = "data hacking.jpg" align = "left" width = "350" height = "300"> <font size = +2> Never tell anyone your passwords or write them down. Dont use easy passwords like birthdays and anniversaries. Update your operating system and software frequently. Download up-to-date security programs, including anti-malware software with multiple technologies for protecting against spyware, ransomware, and exploits, as well as a firewall. </font> </p>
