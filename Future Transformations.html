<h2> Overview </h3>
<p> <font size = +2> Like nearly every other industry, the criminal justice field is changing rapidly due to the lightning-fast evolution of technology.
	
	And not just “hard” technology, such as guns and other types of weapons. The use of “soft” technology, such as computers and tracking systems, is becoming just as important to the field.
	
	According to Steven Brancazio, associate faculty chair for Capella University’s School of Public Service Leadership, “the main thing is to keep constitutional rights at the forefront. But there is a lot of technology that does that, and it keeps both sides safe.” Brancazio spent 20 years in law enforcement, including working as a police officer, street crime investigator, squad supervisor, internal affairs investigator, district commander, and captain before making his way to Capella.
	
	Here, he talks in-depth about what technology is doing for criminal justice.. </font> </p>

<h2> Continuing to Evolve </h3>
<p> <font size = +2> Technology developments are driving change in law enforcement and criminal justice methods, and yet, as Brancazio notes, “We’re always one step behind criminals, especially terrorists.”

	That’s why learning about new technology and understanding its advantages and pitfalls are key factors in Capella’s criminal justice degree programs. “I see a bright future and wealth of career opportunities for people with expertise in criminal justice technology.”
